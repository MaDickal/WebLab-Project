##Users
There are 3 different users with varying access to the database. These users are:

* Observer - has General Access
* Researcher - has Researcher Access
* Administrator - has Administrator Access

###User Specs

1. General Access - submits data to the database by filling out a form. Has no other access to the database. Username or password is not needed.
2. Researcher Access - able to login to the website to access the list of flora that has been submitted to the database, able to download the list in excel or pdf formats.
3. Administrator Access - same as Researcher Access with the addition of being able to maintain the database.

##Resources
To put this together I will be using HTML, CSS, PHP, and mySQL. The database will be mySQL as thatâ€™s what the administrator is familiar with. I will first build the front-end to gather the information, then proceed with the back-end to create the database, and finally link it together.
